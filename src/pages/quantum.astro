      <p class="">
        Quantum Capital and its affiliates (“QCIG”) manage private investment
        funds using a value-based philosophy with a fundamental bottoms-up
        approach to analyzing each investment. We focus primarily on emerging
        markets, investing on public and private markets across corporate
        credit, structured credit, real estate, and equity securities. The fund
        focuses on Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Spain and North American
        markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quantum was legally established with limited liability under the laws of
        the British Virgin Islands on February 2, 2021, and began its operations
        on December 31, 2021, as a registered open-ended investment scheme.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        For its investment management activities, Quantum has engaged Quantum
        Capital Management LLC ("QCM" or "the Investment Manager"), an entity
        founded on the principles of strategic investment in high-quality
        businesses believed to have limited downside and capable of generating
        predictable, recurring cash flows. Under the strategic direction and
        supervision of Quantum's Board of Directors, QCM is tasked with the
        prudent investment of the company's assets and liabilities, aligning
        with Quantum's investment policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of Quantum's investment portfolio is deliberately allocated
        across 10 to 14 core holdings, predominantly in liquid, listed large
        capitalization companies primarily based on Latin and North America. The
        Investment Manager employs a focused approach towards identifying
        companies that exhibit strong business fundamentals. Additionally,
        Quantum Capital Ltd and its Investment Manager employ strategic risk
        management techniques, including the judicious selection of investments
        and portfolio construction, and potentially utilizing hedging strategies
        to mitigate market-related risks and capitalize on asymmetric investment
        opportunities.
